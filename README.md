## ZMK, corne and Keeb
This is a ZMK configuration repo for corne.
According to Keeb, the wireless version of corne is using ZMK.
The default keymap is in https://keebmaker.com/pages/default-keymaps .
For changes other than to the keymap, refer to the ZMK docs:
https://zmk.dev/docs/development/documentation .

## Change keymaps: Use ZMK keymap config
We first try to use the default ZMK keymap setup from Keeb:
We print out the default keymap config and try to adapt to that configuration.

If some keymap setup can not work very well after several days,
we will change the ZMK keymaps by flashing the ZMK keymaps using this repo.
